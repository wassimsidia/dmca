Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
I coded and sold a steam trading bot (unlicensed, no permission to distribute), and this user is distributing it for free without any permission whatsoever. My name can even be found as author in the bot's package.json file ([private]).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
https://github.com/b0gotac/steam-lvlup-bot

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes, these are the forks I found:  
https://github.com/Unparanormal/steam-lvlup-bot  
https://github.com/SullFurix/steam-lvlup-bot  
https://github.com/Retord/steam-lvlup-bot  
https://github.com/Necrno/steam-lvlup-bot  
All of these users did not get my permission to share my work, I would appreciate it if their forks could also be taken down.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
My work is not licensed under an open source license, it is protected by its copyright owned by me, which these users are breaching.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
I would like the repo's to be taken down and the user in question to stop distributing my work.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
I do not.
